# Named Entity Recognition

This project focuses on automated resume extraction using Named Entity Recognition (NER) with spaCy in Python. The goal is to develop a model capable of identifying key information from resumes, such as names, contact details, skills, education, work experience, and more. The process begins with loading and preprocessing a structured dataset containing annotated resume text. A blank spaCy model is initialized, and an NER pipeline is integrated to recognize domain-specific entities. The model is trained on this labeled dataset, learning to extract relevant information accurately. By continuously fine-tuning the model with training iterations, the system improves its ability to detect and classify named entities in unstructured resume text. The project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook, making it easy to experiment with, analyze, and refine the model. This NER-based resume parsing system can be extended to automate candidate screening, HR analytics, or recruitment workflows by efficiently structuring resume data.
